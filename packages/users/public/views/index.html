                    Why? - Facebook is a service with real information about users. One of the major issues in Buying and Selling is that people sometimes lie about information. This allows people to easily <span>flake<span> on other people and / or cheat them in one way or another. Anonymity is not a good thing when it comes to organizing meet ups. By having the actual Facebook account on record, user to user meetups are more secure.
