    <span class="faq">I want to suggest something for the site</span>
      You can send us a message about what you want added. We will most certainly listen and add it to our To Do list. Hey want a free upgrade. Depending on what feedback you give, if we find it considerably helpful and time saving we might give you a free upgrade on your account (that is if you want one).

    <span class="faq">I want to work with SpaceTrades</span>
      As long as we are mutually benefitting we are interested. Contact us at example@email.com. 
      OR
      call us at: 123-456-7891,  A nice person will answer you.

    <span class="faq">I want to have a better experience</span>
     Well you can buy an upgrade. We offer 3 different main upgrades. Without giving us money you certainly won't be able to have a better experience.

      We don't want to make our free service crappy or use lots of ads. We don't like ads and were guessing you don't like them either. Ads are good when they display things a visitor will like. The ad is effectively saving the user time. Any other useage of ads makes the site look bad. 

    <span class="faq">Shoes Upgrade</span>
      When meeting up with people there are many things that are worth the investment. We take advantage of this. The shoes upgrade provides the buyer these cpabilities:

    <span class="faq">Electronics Upgrade</span>

    <span class="faq">Clothing Upgrade</span>

    <span class="faq">Hey isn't this site like craigslist?</span>
      Yeah it is. We have significantly improved many of the capabilities that craigslist has. Additionally we are focused only on a few select categories: Shoes, Electronics, 
      Until they beat us in this aspect there is a reason for SpaceTrades to exist
