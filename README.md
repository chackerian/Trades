Custom Packages are generated by the mean scaffolder and contain most of your application logic. Custom packages are found in /packages/custom and can be published as a contrib package for use by other developers.
Contrib Packages are installed by the mean installer and are found at /packages/contrib. Contrib packages are "plug and play".
Core Packages
All Core packages can be overridden by other packages allowing you to extend and adapt it to fit your specific needs. See overriding core packages for detailed examples

System
The system package creates the basic pages as well as defines the layout of the site and integrates the menu into the page. The system package also allows us to define things such as rendering engines, static files and routing on the client and server side.

Users
The users package creates the database model of the user, provides validation as well as various login and registration features.

Access
The access package managers permissions and middleware. It controls the various authentication methods and is dependent on the users package

Theme
The theme package adds some basic CSS and other assets such as images and backgrounds

Articles
Articles package is typically used as an example, starting point for managing content that might be used in a blog or cms. The full CRUD is implemented on the server and client.

mean postinstall
git branch -D [name]
git push --all origin
This will push tags and branches.

$ npm install -g grunt-cli

## Additional Packages
* Express - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Passport - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* AngularJS - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* Twitter Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* UI Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.

## Quick Install
  The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to install the `meanio` package from NPM.

  Install MEAN CLI:

    $ [sudo] npm install -g meanio@latest
    $ mean init <myApp>
    $ cd <myApp> && npm install

  We recommend using [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) to start the server:

    $ grunt

  If grunt aborts because of JSHINT errors, these can be overridden with the `force` flag:

    $ grunt -f

  Alternatively, when not using `grunt` you can run:

    $ node server

  Then, open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000


## Troubleshooting
During install some of you may encounter some issues.

Most issues can be solved by one of the following tips, but if are unable to find a solution feel free to contact us via the repository issue tracker or the links provided below.

#### Update NPM, Bower or Grunt
Sometimes you may find there is a weird error during install like npm's *Error: ENOENT*. Usually updating those tools to the latest version solves the issue.

* Updating NPM:
```
$ npm update -g npm
```

* Updating Grunt:
```
$ npm update -g grunt-cli
```

* Updating Bower:
```
$ npm update -g bower
```

#### Cleaning NPM and Bower cache
NPM and Bower has a caching system for holding packages that you already installed.
We found that often cleaning the cache solves some troubles this system creates.

* NPM Clean Cache:
```
$ npm cache clean
```

* Bower Clean Cache:
```
$ bower cache clean
```

#### Installation problems on Windows 8 / 8.1
Some of Mean.io dependencies uses [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) with supported Python version 2.7.x. So if you see an error related to node-gyp rebuild follow next steps:

1. install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. install [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/download/details.aspx?id=34673)
3. fire NPM update
````
$ npm update -g
````

## Configuration
All configuration is specified in the [config](/config/) folder, through the [env](config/env/) files, and is orchestrated through the [meanio](https://github.com/linnovate/mean-cli) NPM module. Here you will need to specify your application name, database name, and hook up any social app keys if you want integration with Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, or Google.

### Environmental Settings

There is a shared environment config: __all__.
* __root__ - This the default root path for the application.
* __port__ - DEPRECATED to __http.port__ or __https.port__.
* __http.port__ - This sets the default application port.
* __https__ - These settings are for running HTTPS / SSL for a secure application.
  * __port__ - This sets the default application port for HTTPS / SSL. If HTTPS is not used then is value is to be set to __false__ which is the default setting. If HTTPS is to be used the standard HTTPS port is __443__. 
  * __ssl.key__ - The path to public key.
  * __ssl.cert__ - The path to certificate.

There are three environments provided by default: __development__, __test__, and __production__.

Each of these environments has the following configuration options:

* __db__ - This is where you specify the MongoDB / Mongoose settings
  * __url__ - This is the url/name of the MongoDB database to use, and is set by default to __mean-dev__ for the development environment.
  * __debug__ - Setting this option to __true__ will log the output all Mongoose executed collection methods to your
console.  The default is set to __true__ for the development environment.
  * __options__ - These are the database options that will be passed directly to mongoose.connect in the __production__ environment: [server, replset, user, pass, auth, mongos] (http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options) or read [this] (http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html#mongoclient-connect-options) for more information.
* __app.name__ - This is the name of your app or website, and can be different for each environment. You can tell which environment you are running by looking at the TITLE attribute that your app generates.
* __Social OAuth Keys__ - Facebook, GitHub, Google, Twitter. You can specify your own social application keys here for each platform:
  * __clientID__
  * __clientSecret__
  * __callbackURL__
* __emailFrom__ - This is the from email address displayed when sending an email.
* __mailer__ - This is where you enter your email service provider, username and password.

To run with a different environment, just specify NODE_ENV as you call grunt:

    $ NODE_ENV=test grunt

If you are using node instead of grunt, it is very similar:

    $ NODE_ENV=test node server

To simply run tests

    $ npm test

> NOTE: Running Node.js applications in the __production__ environment enables caching, which is disabled by default in all other environments.

## Maintaining your own repository
After initializing a project, you'll see that the root directory of your project is already a git repository. MEAN uses git to download and update its own code. To handle its own operations, MEAN creates a remote called `upstream`. This way you can use git as you would in any other project.

To maintain your own public or private repository, add your repository as remote. See here for information on [adding an existing project to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

```
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
git push -u origin master
```


## Getting Started
We pre-included an article example. Check out:

  * [The Model](packages/articles/server/models/article.js) - Where we define our object schema.
  * [The Controller](packages/articles/server/controllers/articles.js) - Where we take care of our backend logic.
  * [NodeJS Routes](packages/articles/server/routes/articles.js) - Where we define our REST service routes.
  * [AngularJs Routes](packages/articles/public/routes/articles.js) - Where we define our CRUD routes.
  * [The AngularJs Service](packages/articles/public/services/articles.js) - Where we connect to our REST service.
  * [The AngularJs Controller](packages/articles/public/controllers/articles.js) - Where we take care of  our frontend logic.
  * [The AngularJs Views Folder](packages/articles/public/views) - Where we keep our CRUD views.

## Heroku Quick Deployment
Before you start make sure you have the [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
installed and an accessible MongoDB instance - you can try [MongoHQ](http://www.mongohq.com/)
which has an easy setup).

Add the db string to the production env in server/config/env/production.js.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial version"
heroku apps:create
heroku config:add NODE_ENV=production
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/mbuchetics/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt.git
git push heroku master
heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
```
